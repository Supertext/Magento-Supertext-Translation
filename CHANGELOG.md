# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Added: Export for translation (XLIFF 1.2 or HTML) and import of translated files; Supertext SDK 0.5.0. The *Translate with Supertext* page gets **Export for translation** (the selected items and ticked store views as `magento-product-42-store-2.xlf`, or one item in one store view as HTML) and **Import translation** (upload up to 10 MB, read in memory; written back exactly like a translation with Supertext, with a summary per item and store view: imported, skipped because the source changed, not translated, formatting changed, not in the file, kept).
- Changed: Supertext SDK 0.5.0. Since 0.4.0, a store view without a Supertext language whose locale has an obvious default uses it instead of being *not mapped*: `es_ES` → `es`, `nl_NL` → `nl`, `zh_Hans_CN` → `zh-Hans`. Locales without a default (`de_LU`, `en_IE`, `fr_BE`) still need the setting.
- Changed: version reports, the API key check result and the reachability ping now use Supertext Plugin Health 0.1.0 (bundled in `lib/supertext-plugin-health/`); Supertext SDK updated to 0.3.0. No change for shops: settings and stored state stay as they are.
- Changed: **languages are no longer guessed.** The store view setting is now **Supertext language**, a list of Supertext's own codes, instead of a free-text code. A store view whose locale is a Supertext code (`de_CH` → `de-CH`, `fr_FR` → `fr-FR`, apart from case and `_`/`-`) needs nothing; every other locale (`es_ES`, `nl_NL`, `sl_SI`, `zh_Hans_CN`) needs a choice. The default regions are gone: they were wrong for most languages (Supertext wants `es`, `sl`, `nl` without region, `zh-Hans` instead of `zh-CN`). A store view without a Supertext language is marked *Not mapped* in the new *Store views* overview (*Default Config* scope), can't be ticked on the translate page, and translating into it fails with *The language "…" has no Supertext language yet*; nothing is sent for it. The default store view's setting also serves the source language. Codes saved before keep working.
- Changed: formal or informal tone is only sent where Supertext offers it; for English, Swiss German, Romansh, Albanian and Serbian the Supertext default is used, and the overview says so. New message *Supertext offers no formal or informal tone for this language* for the rare case Supertext still refuses it.
- Added: automatic **API key check** (Supertext's cost-free `features` call) when the configuration is saved, on *Test connection*, for a key that hasn't been checked yet (e.g. from `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY`) and when Supertext rejects the key during a translation. The configuration shows the latest result with its time under *API key check*; invalid and missing keys come with the links to create an account and generate a key.
- Added: **Send version information to Supertext** (on by default; `SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS=0` turns it off): when the configuration is saved and after an update, the module sends the shop URL, the module, Magento, PHP and SDK versions, whether a key is set, the key check result and the ping address to Supertext. No content, no API key and no personal data.
- Added: public ping endpoint `/supertext/ping` (never cached), which only echoes Supertext's challenge so Supertext can check that the shop is reachable (404 with version information off).
- Changed: bundled Supertext SDK 0.2.1 (commit `eeba8fa`, `V1` namespace) with the language list, the key check and the version reports.
- Changed: Supertext calls now go through the [Supertext SDK for PHP](https://github.com/Supertext/Supertext-API-SDK-and-Guide), bundled with the module (`lib/supertext-sdk/`); the module's own API client is gone. No change to installation; requires ext-curl, as Magento does.
- Changed: clearer messages when Supertext rejects a store view's language ("Supertext does not translate from "en" into "xx"" with a pointer to the store view's *Supertext language*), when its answer is incomplete (nothing is saved for that item), and *Authentication failed* now also links to the Supertext sign-up page, in all four interface languages.
- Fixed: a target language Supertext doesn't know is now reported as an unsupported language ("Supertext does not translate from … into …"), not as "resource not found".
- Added: German, French and Italian admin interface. The module's screens and messages, including errors from Supertext, follow the admin user's interface locale (`i18n/` for de_DE, de_AT, de_CH, fr_FR, fr_BE, fr_CA, fr_CH, it_IT, it_CH).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-08

- First version: Magento 2 module `Supertext_Translation` (Mage-OS 3.5 / Magento 2.4.9 tested; Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce 2.4.7+ supported; PHP 8.2+).
- **Translate with Supertext** as a mass action in *Catalog → Products*, *Content → Pages* and *Content → Blocks*, and as a button on the edit pages of products, categories, pages and blocks.
- Translate page: the store views to translate into (other languages ticked), the current state per item and store view, and an explicit *Overwrite existing translations* option with a warning. Translations run one item and store view at a time, with the result shown per cell.
- Products and categories: name, descriptions, meta title, keywords and description are saved as store-view values; the URL key follows the translated name, with URL rewrites (the old URL redirects).
- CMS pages and blocks: a translated copy per store view with the same URL key or identifier, linked to the original; the original page is removed from that store view. New copies keep the original's status, or are created disabled (setting).
- Rich text keeps its formatting, Page Builder markup and Magento directives (`{{widget}}`, `{{media}}`, `{{store}}`, `{{config}}`).
- Fills only fields that are empty or still show the default value, unless *Overwrite* is ticked.
- Configuration: API key (encrypted; with or without the `Supertext-Auth-Key` prefix; `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` wins), links to create a Supertext account and generate the key, *Test connection*, API environment, custom endpoint (`SUPERTEXT_API_ENDPOINT` wins), timeout, per-store-view Supertext language code and tone, status of new CMS copies, module version linked to its release.
- ACL resources *Translate with Supertext* and *Supertext Translation* (configuration).
- Requests that hit Supertext's per-second rate limit are retried automatically.
- CLI: `bin/magento supertext:translate <product|category|cms_page|cms_block> <ids> [--store=<code>] [--overwrite]`.
- Demo for Railway (`demo/`): Mage-OS 3.5 on MySQL and Elasticsearch with German (CH), French (CH) and Italian (CH) store views, sample products, category, Page Builder page and block, a *Supertext editor* role, and `DEMO_ADMIN_*` / `DEMO_EDITOR_*` accounts created on every start.
- Docs with screenshots, regenerated by `tests/docs/screenshots.mjs` against a stand-in API.
