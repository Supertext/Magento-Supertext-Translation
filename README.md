# Supertext Translation for Magento

Translate Magento products, categories, CMS pages and blocks into your store views' languages with **Supertext AI**, straight from the admin lists and edit pages. Works with Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce and Mage-OS.

Select products in *Catalog → Products* (or pages and blocks in *Content*), choose **Translate with Supertext** in the **Actions** menu, pick the store views and click **Translate**. Product and category texts are saved as each store view's own values, so they show up in that store view right away; pages and blocks get a translated copy per store view.

- Works with Magento's own store views and locales: no extra multilingual extension needed
- Translates names, descriptions, SEO fields and page/block content; formatting, links, Page Builder layouts and `{{…}}` directives are kept
- URL keys follow the translated name, with URL rewrites and a redirect from the old URL
- Fills only untranslated store-view values unless you tick *Overwrite existing translations*, with a clear warning first
- Formal or informal tone and custom Supertext language codes per store view
- Also on the command line: `bin/magento supertext:translate product 1 2 --store=de_ch`
