# Supertext Translation for Magento

Translate Magento products, categories, CMS pages and blocks into your store views' languages with **Supertext AI**, straight from the admin lists and edit pages. Works with Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce and Mage-OS.

Select products in *Catalog → Products* (or pages and blocks in *Content*), choose **Translate with Supertext** in the **Actions** menu, pick the store views and click **Translate**. Product and category texts are saved as each store view's own values, so they show up in that store view right away; pages and blocks get a translated copy per store view.

- Works with Magento's own store views and locales: no extra multilingual extension needed
- Translates names, descriptions, SEO fields and page/block content; formatting, links, Page Builder layouts and `{{…}}` directives are kept
- URL keys follow the translated name, with URL rewrites and a redirect from the old URL
- Fills only untranslated store-view values unless you tick *Overwrite existing translations*, with a clear warning first
- A Supertext language per store view (a select of Supertext's own codes; obvious defaults such as es_ES → es, nothing else guessed) and a formal or informal tone where Supertext offers one
- Automatic API key check and optional version information for Supertext support (on by default, `SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS=0` turns it off)
- **Export for translation** (XLIFF 1.2 or HTML) and **Import translation** of translated files, for translation tools, translators or Supertext's web app, on the same page
- Also on the command line: `bin/magento supertext:translate product 1 2 --store=de_ch`

## Export for translation and import (XLIFF and HTML)

Besides translating with Supertext AI, you can export a product, category, CMS page or block as a file, have it translated elsewhere and import the result.

- **Where:** the export and import sections at the bottom of the *Translate with Supertext* page.
- **Formats:** XLIFF 1.2 for translation tools such as Trados, memoQ or Phrase (formatting travels as protected tags; several target languages in one file), or HTML (one language per file) for translators or Supertext's web app, which keeps the file's head and `data-st-id` attributes, so the translated file imports as it is.
- **Import:** the file says what it was exported from and for which language. The translations are written with the same rules as a Supertext AI translation, and a summary shows what was imported and what was skipped: source changed since the export (import those anyway with *Also import texts whose source changed since the export*), not translated, formatting changed, not in the file.
- **Safe:** files over 10 MB, files from another system and translations that add markup the source doesn't have are refused; uploaded files aren't stored.
